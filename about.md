A small collection of editor features to make my life a little easier.

---

### <c-8BC81A>Multi-Edit Triggers</c>

Select <c-E7FFB2>**multiple triggers**</c> and <c-EBFFB2>**right click**</c> on an input (or use the <c-EFFFB2>**toggle button**</c>) to independently modify values across different triggers. Perform operations like addition and multiplication to quickly change values. Select a direction to compound operations across multiple triggers.

If multiple <c-F3FFB2>**different types of triggers**</c> are selected, common properties like group ID and duration can be changed simultaneously.

### <c-B6C81A>Improved Select Filter</c>

Located in the delete menu. Filter objects not only by group and color, but also <c-FDFFB2>**scale, HSV, Z order, and Z layer**</c>. Objects can be filtered by a <c-FFFAB2>**range or series**</c> of values.

### <c-C8AE1A>Advanced Paste State</c>

Pasting state now opens a menu that allows you to <c-FFEDB2>**change which properties are pasted**</c>. You can also paste additional properties such as <c-FFE6B2>**object id, position, rotation, and scale**</c>. Double click the paste state button to quickly paste the default state.

### <c-C8821A>Universal Next Free Buttons</c>

Adds buttons to trigger menus to autofill the next free <c-FFD6B2>**group, item, collision block, timer, control, and material IDs**</c>.

### <c-C8561A>Multi-Edit HSV</c>

The same multi-edit system for triggers also works for <c-FFC8B2>**HSV adjustments**</c>. Mixed state is also handled much better, so for instance, if two objects have <c-FFC3B2>**different hues**</c>, you can still change their brightnesses <c-FFBEB2>**at once**</c>.

### <c-C82A1A>Evenly Distribute Groups</c>

Located in the editor pause menu. Evenly distribute a <c-FFB2B4>**set of groups**</c> between the selected objects.

### <c-C81A35>Hide Trigger UI</c>

While in a trigger popup, <c-FFB2C4>**hold shift**</c> to hide the trigger UI. For mobile users, enable the <c-FFB2CA>**Hide UI**</c> button and move a slider to hide everything except that slider.

### <c-C81A60>Saw Rotation Preview</c>

Shows a <c-FFB2DA>**preview object**</c> when adjusting the rotation speed of a sawblade.

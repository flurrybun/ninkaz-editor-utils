A small collection of editor features to make my life a little easier.

---

### Multi-Edit Triggers

Select **multiple triggers** and **right click** on an input (or use the **toggle button**) to independently modify values across different triggers. Perform operations like addition and multiplication to quickly change values. Select a direction to compound operations across multiple triggers.

If multiple **different types of triggers** are selected, common properties like group ID and duration can be changed simultaneously.

### Improved Select Filter

Located in the delete menu. Filter objects not only by group and color, but also **scale, HSV, Z order, and Z layer**. Objects can be filtered by a **range or series** of values.

### Advanced Paste State

Pasting state now opens a menu that allows you to **change which properties are pasted**. You can also paste additional properties such as **object id, position, rotation, and scale**. Double click the paste state button to quickly paste the default state.

### Universal Next Free Buttons

Adds buttons to trigger menus to autofill the next free **group, item, collision block, timer, control, and material IDs**.

### Multi-Edit HSV

The same multi-edit system for triggers also works for **HSV adjustments**. Mixed state is also handled much better, so for instance, if two objects have **different hues**, you can still change their brightnesses **at once**.

### Evenly Distribute Groups

Located in the editor pause menu. Evenly distribute a **set of groups** between the selected objects.

### Hide Trigger UI

While in a trigger popup, **hold shift** to hide the trigger UI. For mobile users, enable the **Hide UI** button and move a slider to hide everything except that slider.

### Saw Rotation Preview

Shows a **preview object** when adjusting the rotation speed of a sawblade.
